## What VRX is
A local desktop Electron companion app for **VRChat** and **ChilloutVR** — like VRCX/CVRX, merged
into one. Authenticates AS THE USER on their own machine; reads only that user's social data
(friends, presence, instances, invites). NOT a bot, NOT a server, NOT a content uploader.

## Design language — the single source of truth
The full visual + interaction spec lives in **`docs/DESIGN.md`** (agent spec, MUST/NEVER rules) with
a human-rendered guide at `docs/design.html` and the living reference `docs/glass.html`.
Before touching ANY UI, read DESIGN.md. Hard rules in brief:
- Liquid-glass material; dark is default, light is a `[data-theme="light"]` override (parity, not a fork).
- **Color = meaning, never decoration.** Each meaning owns one fixed location + a non-color glyph (§5).
- Platform = blue (VRChat) / orange (ChilloutVR), carried by tint+spine+glyph only.
- Presence is TWO axes: `state` (the dot) vs `status` (the VRChat pill) — never conflate
  (`status:"active"`→Online vs `state:"active"`→not-in-game).
- All tokens/spacing come from the design tokens; never hardcode hex outside them.

## Architecture
- electron-vite + React 19 + TypeScript (strict). Three processes: `src/main`, `src/preload`, `src/renderer`.
- Cross-process shared code lives in `src/shared` (imported via the `@shared` alias). Keep it PURE —
  no `electron`/`node` imports (it bundles into the sandboxed renderer). Types + plain values only.
- Adapter pattern for the two platforms; Zustand stores; TanStack Query for fetch/cache.
- Use string-literal unions, not `const enum` (esbuild-safe, Zod-friendly).

## Security non-negotiables (every BrowserWindow / IPC PR)
`contextIsolation:true`, `sandbox:true`, `nodeIntegration:false`; `isTrustedIpcSender` guard on every
IPC handler; `safeStorage` for all credentials; URL allowlist before `shell.openExternal`; no
`unsafe-inline` CSP; renderer never sees raw tokens. Never log credentials/tokens/PII (use electron-log).
Never write to VRCX/CVRX folders.

## API etiquette (VRChat + CVR are unofficial APIs)
- Real-time data via WebSocket (VRChat Pipeline / CVR `/users/ws`), NOT polling — polling friend status
  is the #1 cause of rate-limiting/account flags.
- 1 req/sec safe ceiling, exponential backoff, jittered intervals (never fixed clock), proper User-Agent.
- No mass-invite (= botting). Defensive parsing — unknown enum values degrade gracefully, never crash.

## Workflow rules
- **Never commit or push unless explicitly asked.** `main` is branch-protected; owner reviews + merges —
  agents never self-merge. STOP after opening a PR.
- Branch names exactly `imperix/vrx-XX-slug`; commit messages reference `vrx-XX`.
- No hardcoded `C:\`/`%APPDATA%`/`~` paths — use `app.getPath()`. No `console.log` (electron-log).
  No `any`/`@ts-ignore` without an explanation comment.
- Verify before declaring done: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build` must pass.

## Linear
Project tracked on Linear (team VRX). Issues `VRX-N`. Release scope: `v1.0` label = ships in 1.0,
`v1.x` = deferred. M1 (Foundation) must be complete before other milestones.

**Board hygiene rule — update Linear as you go:**
- When starting work on an issue → set it to **In Progress**.
- When a PR is opened → set it to **In Review**.
- When work is confirmed done (`typecheck + lint + build` pass, PR merged) → set it to **Done**
  with a brief description of what was built/verified.
- Never leave the board stale. If you completed something and Linear still shows Backlog, fix it
  before ending the session.
- Use the Linear MCP tools (`save_issue` with `state:`) — do not ask the user to update the board
  manually unless the change requires their authorization (e.g. closing a milestone).

<!-- BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES (mirrored from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) -->

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## Behavioral Guideline 1: Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## Behavioral Guideline 2: Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## Behavioral Guideline 3: Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## Behavioral Guideline 4: Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Behavioral Guideline 5: Code Review Checkpoints

**After completing a feature, fix, or meaningful set of changes, ask:**

> "Want me to do a code review pass — checking for dead code, duplication, and anything that looks off?"

When:
- A feature or update is functionally complete
- A bug fix is done and verified
- A refactor wraps up
- Any time the user signals "we're done with this"

Don't run a review automatically on every edit — only offer at natural stopping points. If the user says yes, run both:
- **Fallow** (`fallow dead-code`, `fallow dupes`) — for dead code, unused exports, and duplication
- **`/code-review`** (built-in skill) — for logic bugs, correctness, security, and broader code quality
